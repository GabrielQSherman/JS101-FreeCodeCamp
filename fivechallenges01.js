
//First challenge is to initialize the variables 
//so the correct output is returned

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

// Understand that variables are strickly case sensitive 
// it is important to camel case variable names to keep code clean and eaisly readable

var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

// one of the data types frquently used in JavaScript is the 'Number' data type 
// this challange has us modifiying the initialization of the var 'sum'
//the '+' is used for additon
var sum = 10 + 10;
//expected output is 20

//another operator is '-' or subtraction
var diffrence = 45 - 33;
//expected output is 12

//another operator is '*' or multipication
var product = 8 * 10;
//expected output is 80

//another operator is '/' or division
var quotient = 66 / 33;
//expected output is 2

//output in terminal for what I learned
//console.log(sum,diffrence, product, quotient, a, b, c);
