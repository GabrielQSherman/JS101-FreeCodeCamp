// in JavaScript we can find the remainder of a quotient by using the % operator
/* Tip;
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
*/

var remainder = 11 % 3;

// a very useful way to shorten code is to use the '"operator"=' to make code like a = a + 2 to look like a+=2. they both do the same thing

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;
// FCC wants to modify the code so it uses '+='
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

//this logic can be aplied to any mathimatical operator in JS
var a1 = 11;
var b1 = 9;
var c1 = 3;
//now with the subraction operator
a1 -= 6;
b1 -= 15;
c1 -= 1;

//Now with the multiplication operator
var a2 = 5;
var b2 = 12;
var c2 = 4.6;
a2 *= 5;
b2 *= 3;
c2 *= 10;

//Now with the division operator
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
