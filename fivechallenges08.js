//the .push() method is very useful for minipulating arrays
//here they would like me to add a [dog, 3] subarray to this two dimensional array
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
myArray.push(["dog", 3]);

//the .pop() method allows you to remove an item at the end of an array or subarray
