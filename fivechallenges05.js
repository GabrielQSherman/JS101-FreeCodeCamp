//This challenge teaches that you can concatenate strings with the same 'plus equals' that we previously used on number equations
 var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
 myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

 //There is also another way to concat and apend strings, as well as variables of any kind with ' "string" + variableName '
 var myName = "gabe";
 var myNameStr =  "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!"
 
 //This challenge combines the last two!
 var someAdjective = "fantastic";
 var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
 myStr += someAdjective;
